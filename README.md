# One way to think about Tetris problem

## About
The project is an attempt to solve the Tetris problem with some core AI concepts 
(e.g. agents, the environment, state space) and visualize this process.

## TODO
+ An agent should not rotate a figure when a figure could not rotated (for example, when a figure strikes the walls)
+ An agent should use more appropriate estimation of the optimal solution
+ PriorityQueue (data structure) have to use the Heap
